# Cpp-Dynamic-Allocation-Array_ex-
A Dynamic Memory Allocation Array Application Example - Find the mode of an random array

***********************************************************************************
Instruction 
-
You are required to add following requirements in this problem
a. Ask the user to enter the size of an array in main method. The program should validate
the size of an array, if it is not in between 5 to 50 (inclusive), ask the user to re-enter
until it is valid.
b. Call the function given in programming challenge “Array Allocator”, and
create an array of the size provided by the user.
c. Populate the array with random integer numbers 0 to 9 using seed value as 6000 in
main method and display the contents of the array.
d. Implement the mode function as given in the problem.
e. Display the mode of the array with its frequency (number of times the mode value
occurred in the array).
Submit two screen captures, (1) when there is no mode (2) when the frequency of the mode value is
greater than or equal to 4.
